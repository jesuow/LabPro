Por ejemplo, en el grupo B, el rango de GPA es bastante amplio en todos los niveles educativos, con algunos estudiantes obteniendo calificaciones más bajas, especialmente en \"school\". En cambio, el grupo A tiene un rango más limitado, y sus estudiantes tienden a obtener calificaciones más consistentes, aunque ligeramente más bajas que otros grupos en los niveles \"college\" y \"postgraduate\".
